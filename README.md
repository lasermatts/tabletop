# Purpose
### We're going to track some of the more esoteric parts of being a dork here. I'm going on 25 sessions as a Druid with some of my coworkers, and I've also been homebrewing acampaign based on the Cyberpunk ruleset, so here's to organization instead of throwing all of these things into bits and bobs all over
So, let's break that down into a few components

## TableTop Gaming in General
Let's break down some of the greatest elements of getting together with a group of friends at home and remotely to play some games and flex some minds!
# Did you know:
H.G. Wells, author of _War of the Worlds_ and _The Time Machine_ created and published a tabletop game in 1913! 

You don't have to be a legendary science fiction writer to create legendary fun experiences for your friends!

## DND Tabletop Gaming
I'm currently playing a Druid in a 5 person party with a group of my friends. One of the hardest parts of being a druid, apart from your horrific charisma, if keeping track of the animals you've encountered.
**ENTER: This Repo** -- what a nifty place I can keep track of all of the lovely aminals I've encountered, __and__ I don't feel like a jag hauling around the Beasts Guide freaking out our DM.

## Cyberpunk 
1. I think after you take your first signal processing exam they pump some magic gas in the room to make you love Cyberpunk
2. I work on cars that drive themselves, and as they say: " <art imitates life> "
So, here we are. One day I'll get around to adding the ideas I've had for the homebrew, but for now, the directory rests.
