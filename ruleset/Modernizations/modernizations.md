# The Year is 2021. 
The world is hoping to recover (mostly, except for the wacky parts that ignore science) from a global pandemic. An intrepid engineer in Pittsburgh started on a TableTop RPG adventure with a group of colleagues.

## Flash forward to 2023.
January. Still intrepid, still in Pittsburgh. Except...the rest of our party isn't any more. We're still going strong, but now a few of us are traveling around the country. Our DM has even moved out of state.

_The party trudges on._ We adapted! Along the way we found some digital aids, and we still meet over Zoom. 


### This is our first insight: a TTRPG Framework built thinking in *Post-Pandemic* terms!

H. G. Wells talks about his inspiration for his RPG: "THE beginning of the game of Little War, as we know it, became possible with the invention of the spring breechloader gun. "

In a similar way, we've been spending a lot of time spending time on our phones, and on Zoom for....a healthy amount of time that overlaps with the phone time.


Zoom means that we have flexibilty in individuals, and means that we could put more emphasis on the Theater of the Mind and on our character interactions.
