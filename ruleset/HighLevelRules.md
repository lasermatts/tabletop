# What are the things that people love about tabletop gaming?

At its core, a tabletop experience is something that takes place among friends, at a table!

As the world has gone through a global pandemic, where everyone _sits_ at that table has changed, and that can give a new perspective for the TableTop Gaming Experience that's ripe for disruption.

## High Level Themes of TableTop Gaming that Make it Fun
Having a friend with a dream, or a group of people coming up with a dream, or being able to go out and find a world that you love is what makes tabletop gaming great!

Through TableTop Gaming, people can live out lives in Cowboy Westerns, or on submarines on another planet, or in fantasy world of their own making! 

There is a framework that can shake out in enabling people to build their TableTop Gaming fantasies!
### A Master of Ceremonies who helps move things along

### Actually rolling dice
what an incredibly satisfying feeling, to take a fist full of dice and keep them rolling. better than shuffling cards, easier to manage than moving a model, and cheap to acquire, the dice grouping is a great way to base a system of games.
### Variety of Action Choice

### Variety of Characters
When people think, "tabletop gaming," near the top of mind is an infinite freedom of imagination to give a unique character...._character_ 

### Richness of Worldbuilding
This is where a Master of Ceremonies shines. If you're reading this, you're constantly taking inspiration 

### Cleverness of Scenarios
Dungeon is a tough word in gaming, but dungeon building is what we're talking about here. Balance and fairness should always be top of mind, but a system for creating unique and memorable dungeons gives DMs time back for worldbuilding and gives exciting experiences to a party to keep them returning to the table.
### TRAPZ

The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry when THE PARTY ENCOUNTERS A MIMIC INSIDE THE TELEPHONE BOOTH!
Mechanisms and tools for Masters of Ceremonies to build fair and balanced traps are a tretis all on their own. I hope our work can get to that some day!

### Each Characters is their own "person" in a world 

Roles. Jobs. Professions. Specialties. 
All of these are different ways of saying, "different ways that characters have pre-agreed upon walks of life."



## Now what's a cool way we can add in some disruption?

### ENTER: CELL PHONES

### PRESENTING: ZOOM MEETINGS

### Open Sourced Artificial Intelligence 
Generated art. Generated text. The possibilities are endless, and they were (probably) the topic of some TTRPGs just a few years ago, but now they're here.
