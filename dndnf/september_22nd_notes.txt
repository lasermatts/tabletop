Giles: The Serpent is kept at bay by certain magical items. The cat people have metal lamps like the brazier we stole off the trade company boat. These lamps, if lit, can allow you to travel up and down at will and the cat people have almost all of them. The cats are really the only ones who can go up and down.

The real trading company business is dredging magical artifacts from tombs and temples and selling them to….someone. With the rivers locked down they’re on hard times.

Giles has a lead on a boat: There’s a boat at a small camp that’s a bit of a stopover outpost between there and the dam.

The helm of Helm is left in the City of Six Doors and will be under the auction house for three weeks. After that the spirit can’t see where the artifact goes next
