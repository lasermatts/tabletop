##IMPORTS
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#the goal here is to give the program a level of difficulty, and for it to fart out a sudoku-like challenge.

#iteration one will be.....sudoku
#iteration two is doing a little CLI work to play with the sudoku in the command line
#next level is then adding in a nifty timer but we'll see how that goes
